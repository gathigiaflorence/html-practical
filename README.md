# html-practical

This project demonstrates the use of modern **HTML5 features** — focusing on semantics, media elements, tables, and accessibility — within the context of **sports physiotherapy**.  
It is designed to help learners understand how HTML5 can present information about athlete care, rehabilitation, and sports injury tracking.

## 📄 Pages Overview
- **index.html** — Introduces sports physiotherapy with semantic structure, skip links for accessibility, headings, `<blockquote>`, `<time>`, `<abbr>`, and inline code examples (`<code>`, `<kbd>`, `<samp>`).
- **about.html** — Explains the history of sports physiotherapy in Kenya, lists goals for athlete recovery, and uses `<section>`, lists, and a `<dl>` to define key terms like rehabilitation and preventive therapy.
- **media.html** — Includes a responsive `<picture>` image of physiotherapy practice, `<audio>` tips for post-match recovery, and a `<video>` with WebVTT captions showing guided exercises.
- **extras.html** — Demonstrates a weekly physiotherapy training plan in a table (`<caption>/<thead>/<tbody>/<tfoot>`), `<details>` for quick knowledge checks, `<dialog>` for alerts or reminders, and progress indicators (`<progress>`, `<meter>`) to show athlete recovery progress.
